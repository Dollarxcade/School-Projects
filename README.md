# School-Projects
These are projects that are worth sharing that I did in School.
## Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based number guessing game written in **JavaScript**, where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

This was my first-ever coding project, made back in Grade 6 during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Even though it’s under school projects, I didn’t actually learn this in class but this was something I taught myself while online school was going on. While a lot of people were skipping classes to watch YouTube or play games, I ended up spending that time learning how to code instead.

It’s a very basic project, but it’s also the one that got me into programming in the first place, so it has a lot of sentimental value.

## Tic Tac Toe

A console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in **Python**, created during a Grade 8 coding club.

This was my first real attempt at using Python. The code isn’t fully functional — mostly due to the quality of instruction at the time but it still represents an important step in my learning process. You can see me experimenting with game logic, turns, and basic program structure for the first time.

This project is kept as a snapshot of where I was skill-wise at that point, not as a finished product.

## Grade 11 Computer Science Portal

This project is a console-based portal I built during **Grade 11 Computer Science** to make doing worksheets less annoying.

Instead of writing answers on paper and then checking them online, this portal lets everything be done directly through the console. Teachers can access the answers digitally, making the process faster and more organized. This wasn’t an official class assignment — it used concepts well beyond what we were learning at the time — but I built it because it solved a real problem I had.

The system is also easy to extend. If you want to add your own worksheet questions, you can do so by following the comments in the code.
